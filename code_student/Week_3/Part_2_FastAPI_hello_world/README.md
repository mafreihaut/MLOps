# <h1 align="center" id="heading">Part 2: FastAPI Hello World</h1>

For this assignment, our goal will be to run a health check endpoint in FastAPI, push the code to our repo, pull onto EC2, and launch our server and hit the docs endpoint.

Get this to work locally first and then we will pull onto EC2.


Create a `conda` virtual environment using the following code block

``` bash
conda create -n aws_fastapi python=3.8 pip
```

Activate the environment using the following code block

``` bash
conda activate aws_fastapi
```

Install FastAPI using the following code block

``` bash
pip install fastapi
```

Install uvicorn using the following code block

``` bash
pip install uvicorn
```

Save all the `pip` requirements using the following code block

``` bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Open VS Code in your current conda environment

## Write the Health Check endpoint

1. In `main.py` import FastAPI

``` python
from fastapi import FastAPI
```
2. Instantiate FastAPI server object

``` python
app = FastAPI()
```
3. Create a `get` endpoint called `/health`. Might need to google some documentation on this one :)
4. Launch server with the following command locally: `uvicorn main:app --port 8000`
5. Commit changes and push up to your Git repo
6. Connect to EC2 instance
7. Pull changes onto EC2 instance
8. Install libraries in conda environment on EC2 instance by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
9. Launch server again by using `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
10. Hit your server! Go to browser and go to `{public_ip}:8000/docs` and you should see the Swagger docs where you can hit your health check endpoint. 
11. Nice you did it!
## Bonus

1. Put `log_config.py` in same directory as `main.py`

2. Import the following modules:
``` python
import logging
from logging.config import dictConfig
from log_config import log_config # this is your local file
```
3. Next, we'll instantiate dictConfig
``` python
dictConfig(log_config)
```
4. Then we'll instantiate your logger. Please take not of the comment.
``` python
logger = logging.getLogger("my-project-logger") # should be this name unless you change it in log_config.py
```
5. Add log message to health check endpoint. Hint: you might need to google this one if you are unsure of how the logging module works :wink:

6. Test out everything to make sure it works.

7. Can you explain why this wouldn't work out-of-the-box? What do you notice about uvicorn's logging?
